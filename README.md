# Project - Fundamentos de Ciencias de Datos
Final project for the subject Fundamentos de Ciencias de Datos in the TUIA program.

## Description
The project is focused on the implementation of multiple linear regression on a selected dataset, as well as the exploration and search for correlations among the variables in the dataset. A numerical dependent variable of interest and multiple independent variables, which can be both categorical and numerical, need to be chosen.

# Motivation
The chosen dataset consists of records of sales for German cars, including mileage, price, year, engine displacement, transmission type, among others.

The goal of the project is to predict the price based on the characteristics of a car using a linear regression model. The created regression model is also interpreted, analyzing if it fulfills its purpose by interpreting its coefficients and other indicators.

### Contents
Refer to the notebook in the file TPFinal_Enzo_Ferrari.ipynb.
The project guidelines and the dataset are included in the other files of the repository.

## Conclusion
After analyzing the dataset, it is concluded that a linear regression model may not be suitable. For more details, please refer to the notebook.
